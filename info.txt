random state
Controls how the data is shuffled before the split is implemented.
If you don't specify the random_state in the code, then every time you run(execute) your code a new random value is generated and the train and test datasets would have different values each time.
However, if a fixed value is assigned like random_state = 0 or 1 or 42 or any other integer then no matter how many times you execute your code the result would be the same .i.e, same values in train and test datasets.

cross_val_score

The number of folds is defined, by default this is 5
The dataset is split up according to these folds, where each fold has a unique set of testing data
A model is trained and tested for each fold
Each fold returns a metric for it's test data
The mean and standard deviation of these metrics can then be calculated to provide a single metric for the process

feature_importances_
Feature Importance refers to techniques that calculate a score for all the input features for a given model — the scores simply represent the “importance” of each feature. 
A higher score means that the specific feature will have a larger effect on the model that is being used to predict a certain variable.
